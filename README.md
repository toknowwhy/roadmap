# dAbacus roadmap

In this repository, you can find the [dAbacus Ecosystem Roadmap](https://github.com/d-abacus/roadmap/projects/1). To get involved in the community, join our [dAbacus Forum](https://forum.dabacus.org/) and the [dAbacus Discord](https://discord.gg/4MjRckMJZN).

In our roadmap, every item is an issue, so that we can assign and label, close each of them.
